  /// - The type of change (insert, update, delete)
  /// - Individual field changes with before/after values
  /// - Complete document representation (if T extends DocumentSerializable)
  /// - Object ID and collection name
  ///
  /// **Type Parameter:**
  /// - `T`: The type to parse fullDocument into.
  ///  Must extend [DocumentSerializable]
  ///   to enable automatic JSON parsing,
  /// or use custom parsing with documentParser.
  ///
  /// **Platform Support:**
  /// This method is not supported on web platforms and will throw an
  /// [UnsupportedError] if called on web.
  ///
  /// **Usage Examples:**
  ///
  /// Basic usage without document parsing:
  /// ```dart
  /// collection.watchDetailed<dynamic>().listen((change) {
  ///   print('Change type: ${change.changeType}');
  ///   print('Object ID: ${change.objectId}');
  ///   print('Field changes: ${change.fieldChanges.length}');
  /// });
  /// ```
  ///
  /// With custom document parsing:
  /// ```dart
  /// class User extends DocumentSerializable {
  ///   final String name;
  ///   final int age;
  ///
  ///   User({required this.name, required this.age});
  ///
  ///   factory User.fromJsonString(String json) {
  ///     final map = jsonDecode(json);
  ///     return User(name: map['name'], age: map['age']);
  ///   }
  ///
  ///   @override
  ///   Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {'name': name, 'age': age};
  /// }
  ///
  /// collection.watchDetailed<User>().listen((change) {
  ///   print('User name: ${change.fullDocument.name}');
  ///   print('User age: ${change.fullDocument.age}');
  /// });
  /// ```
  ///
  /// **Performance Considerations:**
  /// - Detailed watchers have more overhead than regular watchers
  /// - Field-level change tracking requires additional processing
  /// - Consider using [watchLazy] if you only need change notifications
  /// - The stream automatically handles cleanup when canceled
  ///
  /// **Change Types:**
  /// - [ChangeType.insert]: New object was added to the collection
  /// - [ChangeType.update]: Existing object was modified
  /// - [ChangeType.delete]: Object was removed from the collection
  ///
  /// **Thread Safety:**
  /// This method is thread-safe and can be called from any isolate.
  /// The returned stream will emit changes that occur across all isolates.
  ///
  /// @throws UnsupportedError if called on web platforms
  /// @returns A stream of [ChangeDetail] objects representing database changes

    T Function(Map<String, dynamic> json)? documentParser,
